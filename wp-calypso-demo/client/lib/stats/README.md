Stats
=====
The stats folder houses data modules that interact with the REST API and act as `lists` or models that power the various `/manage/stats` jsx components.

* `summary` - module representing a record returned from the stats summary api
* `summary-list` - a collection module for `summary` records

Please view the `README.md` within each module to learn about usage and dependencies.
